# -Advanced-Text-Compression-for-Article-Summarization-Using-Transformer-and-LSTM-Models-
Developed an innovative text summarization solution to effectively condense articles while retaining key information. The project featured two sophisticated models: a custom-built 4-layer Transformer and a 3-layer stacked LSTM encoder-decoder with global attention. These models were designed from scratch to generate concise and coherent.
